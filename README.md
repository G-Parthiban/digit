# digit rcognizing using Sk learn
step 1:
  import library
  In scikit-learn many data sets available for practicing so we just pull digit data set from sk-learn â€˜s load_digits() function.
step 2:
   Exploring the dataset.
step 3:
  import svm from sklearn than initialize with 0.001 gamma.
step 4:
  fitting data into svm classifier that we had initialize earlier. 
step 5:
  Finally we are ready to predict, we have taken one sample from testing set.
